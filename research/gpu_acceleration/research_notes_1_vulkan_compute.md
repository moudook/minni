# Research Notes: Vulkan Compute

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Topic:** Vulkan Compute Shaders for Inference

## Summary
[To be filled: Feasibility of a pure Vulkan backend]

## Technical Details
- **SPIR-V:** The intermediate language for shaders.
- **Kompute:** A framework that simplifies Vulkan Compute usage.
- **Subgroups:** SIMD-like operations within a workgroup.

## Findings
[To be filled: Boilerplate code size required to run a simple matrix multiplication]

## Implementation Considerations
- Vulkan initialization is verbose.
- Pipeline caching is essential for startup time.

## References/Resources
- [Vulkan Spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/)

## Next Steps
- Find a lightweight C++ wrapper for Vulkan Compute.

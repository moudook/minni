# Research Notes: Neuro-Symbolic Integration

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Topic:** Combining Neural Perception with Symbolic Logic

## Summary
[To be filled: Architectures for "Perception -> Logic -> Action"]

## Technical Details
- **Concept Learning:** Mapping raw pixels to symbolic attributes (Color=Red, Shape=Sphere).
- **Differentiable Logic:** Can we backpropagate through the logic engine?

## Findings
[To be filled: Examples of mobile apps using this hybrid approach]

## Implementation Considerations
- Latency of the bridge between Neural (Tensor) and Symbolic (Object) representations.

## Next Steps
- Design a "Traffic Light" demo: CNN detects light -> Logic decides action.

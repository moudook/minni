# Research Organization

Keep research notes organized by topic.

## Structure
```
research/
├── model_optimization/        # Shrinking models
├── cpu_only_solutions/        # For phones without GPU
├── gpu_acceleration/          # When GPU is available
├── hardware_compatibility/    # Works on different phones
├── android_development/       # Android specific stuff
├── performance_benchmarks/    # Speed tests
└── model_quantization/        # Making models smaller
```

## Naming
- Each topic gets its own folder
- Files: `research_notes_1.md`, `research_notes_2.md`, etc.
- Keep `resources.md` for links and references

## Template
Each research file should have:
- Date
- What you found
- Technical details
- What this means for the project
- Links to sources
- What to try next

## Tips
- Focus on one topic per file
- Include failed experiments too
- Add code examples when helpful
- Update as you learn more
- Think about CPU only phones first
- GPU is extra

# Research Notes: Neural Architecture Search

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Topic:** NAS for Mobile

## Summary
[To be filled: Tools for running NAS without massive compute resources]

## Technical Details
- **Differentiable NAS:** Making the architecture search space continuous (faster to train).
- **Hardware-Aware NAS:** Including latency on target device as part of the loss function (NetAdapt).

## Findings
[To be filled: Comparison of MobileNetV3 (NAS) vs MobileNetV2 (Hand-crafted)]

## Implementation Considerations
- High computational cost to run the search.

## References/Resources
- [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)

## Next Steps
- Review pre-searched architectures available in model zoos.

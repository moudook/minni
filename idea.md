# Edge AI Models on Android Smartphones - Project Idea

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a framework for running AI models directly on Android smartphones, enabling edge computing capabilities without relying on cloud infrastructure. The framework is designed to work on devices without dedicated GPUs but can leverage GPU acceleration when available.

## Goals
- Create an efficient framework for deploying AI models on Android devices
- Optimize model performance for mobile hardware constraints
- Enable offline AI capabilities on smartphones
- Provide tools for model conversion and optimization for mobile deployment
- Support both GPU and CPU-only devices

## Key Features
- Model compression and quantization techniques
- Hardware acceleration support (CPU-first, with GPU/NPU fallback when available)
- Memory-efficient inference engine
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
- Battery optimization strategies
- Graceful degradation on lower-end hardware

## Target Use Cases
- Real-time image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Audio processing
- Computer vision applications
- Privacy-preserving AI applications
